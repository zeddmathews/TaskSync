# TaskSync
TaskSync is a client-server application where clients can create, update, delete, and fetch to-do tasks via gRPC. The project teaches how to define gRPC services in .proto files, implement server logic in Go, connect with clients, and handle typical features such as status codes, metadata, and streaming.
